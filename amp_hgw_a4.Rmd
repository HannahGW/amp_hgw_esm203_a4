### Introduction

Enter short 7-8 sentence introduction here - describe the purpose/motivation of the research and preview the content of the report. 

- spiny lobsters, (*Panulirus interruptus*), are important predators in giant kelp forests.

### Data and Methods

Data for spiny lobster abundance, size, and fishing efforts was collected from August 2012 to December 2018 by the [Santa Barbara Coastal Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER)](http://sbc.lternet.edu//index.html). Data was collected annually by divers in late summer before the start of fishing season at five long-term kelp forest study sites. For more information on collection methods and spatial information, please see the [metadata](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=77&revision=newest). Lobster observations were based on observations from a diver searching 2.5 m areas on opposite sides of a 60 m transect tape, searching through cracks, caves, and other structures. Counts and sizes (mm) of lobsters were compared in Marine Protected Areas (MPA) and Non-Marine Protected Areas (Non-MPA). **Complete section about t-tests and alphas after done with A-C**
Trends in lobster counts and sizes were compared in MPA and Non-MPA by linear regression. All analyses and figures were prepared using R software version 3.6.1. Collaboration between authors was done using GitHub. 

### Results
#### 1. Result A: Changes in lobster abundance by site (2012 - 2018)
The effects of creating Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can be seen in Figure 2. At Isla Vista (IVEE), it seems the creation of an MPA has significantly increase the lobster counts from less than 125 individuals in 2012, to over 800 individuals in 2018. Compared to Naples, another MPA, lobster counts stayed relatively constant, similar to Non-MPA sites.  FINISH RESULTS SECTION ...

  ### What do you think with the MPA listed on the graph? 
# weird to say annual, since the lobbsters are counted every month. Only during a couple months.

#### 2. Result B: Lobster size distribution shifts, 2012 vs 2018


```{r}
lobster_abundance_tidy <- lobster_abundance_sbc %>%
  tidyr::uncount(count)

lobster_size <- lobster_abundance_tidy %>%
  filter(year == c("2018", "2012")) %>% 
  mutate(year=as.character(year))


ggplot(lobster_size, aes(x=size_mm)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill=year), position='identity', alpha=0.5) +

  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5)) +

  facet_wrap(~site_name_long, scales="free_x") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name="Year")




## Need help with this. My vision for this graph is to have overlapping histograms for 2012 and 2018, but to facet wrap it by site. I don't think we need to do any statistical analysis until C.  
  # group_by(site)
  # summarize(avg_size = mean(size_mm))
```

Figure_: this graph shows that the lobster size distribution has stayed relatively constant for 4 of the 5 sites: Arroyo Quemado, Carpinteria, Mohawk, and Naples. For these sites, most lobster sizes were around 80mm in both 2012 ad 2018. The distributions became narrower and more centrlized around the mean between 2012 and 2018. (does this last sentence make sense? im trying to explain that the 2018 distribution is skinnier). However, lobster sizes at Isla Vista changed from 2012 to 2018. The lobster sizes were skewed to the left (or right?) in 2012 (n=_), with most surveyed lobster sizes observed at around 60mm, but in 2018 (n=_) the
