### Introduction

Enter short 7-8 sentence introduction here - describe the purpose/motivation of the research and preview the content of the report. 

- spiny lobsters, (*Panulirus interruptus*), are important predators in giant kelp forests.

Enter photos here as Figure 1.

### Data and Methods

Data for spiny lobster abundance, size, and fishing efforts was collected from August 2012 to December 2018 by the [Santa Barbara Coastal Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER)](http://sbc.lternet.edu//index.html). Data was collected annually by divers in late summer before the start of fishing season at five long-term kelp forest study sites. For more information on collection methods and spatial information, please see the [metadata](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=77&revision=newest). 
Enter brief section here (5-6 sentences) summarizing the data and how it was analyzed. Describe variables being studied in report and include the types of statistical tests performed, significance level used and software (with version) for anaylsis. 

### Results
Finalized data visualizations and perform statistical analyses to do the following. Use useful text that weaves pieces together into a cohesive Results section (not just a series of figures)

###1. Changes in lobster abundance by site

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)
library(tidyr)

lobster_abundance_sbc <- read_csv(here::here("data", "lobster_abundance_sbc_lter.csv"),
                                  na = "-99999") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() 




```


###2. Result A: Lobster size distribution shifts (2012 - 2018)

change site abbreviations to actual names in the sub data set:

- AQUA = Arroyo Quemado
- CARP = Carpinteria
- IVEE = Isla Vista
- MOHK = Mohawk
- NAPL = Naples

2 MPAs= isla vista and naples. MPAs established on Jan 1, 2012. The other 3 sites are not MPAs. 

```{r}
annual_lobsters <- lobster_abundance_sbc %>% 
  rename(c("AQUA", 'CARP', 'IVEE', 'MOHK', 'NAPL'))
  #change names for the sites here
  group_by(site, year) %>% 
  summarise(yearly_lobsters=sum(count))
  #add column to label site as MPA or not? or can specify that ivee and napl are mpas in the graph code  

ggplot(annual_lobsters, aes(x=year, y=yearly_lobsters)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=site)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=site))
  
```


###3. Result B: Mean lobster sizes at MPA vs non-Mpa sites (2012 - 2018)

```{r}
lobster_abundance_tidy <- lobster_abundance_sbc %>%
  tidyr::uncount(count) 
```
