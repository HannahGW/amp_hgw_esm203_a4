### Introduction

Enter short 7-8 sentence introduction here - describe the purpose/motivation of the research and preview the content of the report. 

- spiny lobsters, (*Panulirus interruptus*), are important predators in giant kelp forests.

### Data and Methods

Data for spiny lobster abundance, size, and fishing efforts was collected from August 2012 to December 2018 by the [Santa Barbara Coastal Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER)](http://sbc.lternet.edu//index.html). Data was collected annually by divers in late summer before the start of fishing season at five long-term kelp forest study sites. For more information on collection methods and spatial information, please see the [metadata](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=77&revision=newest). Lobster observations were based on observations from a diver searching 2.5 m areas on opposite sides of a 60 m transect tape, searching through cracks, caves, and other structures. Counts and sizes (mm) of lobsters were compared in Marine Protected Areas (MPA) and Non-Marine Protected Areas (Non-MPA). **Complete section about t-tests and alphas after done with A-C**
Trends in lobster counts and sizes were compared in MPA and Non-MPA by linear regression. All analyses and figures were prepared using R software version 3.6.1. Collaboration between authors was done using GitHub. 

### Results
Finalized data visualizations and perform statistical analyses to do the following. Use useful text that weaves pieces together into a cohesive Results section (not just a series of figures)

#### 1. Result A: Changes in lobster abundance by site (2012 - 2018)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)
library(tidyr)

lobster_abundance_sbc <- read_csv(here::here("data", "lobster_abundance_sbc_lter.csv"),
                                  na = "-99999") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() 

```

change site abbreviations to actual names in the sub data set:

- AQUA = Arroyo Quemado
- CARP = Carpinteria
- IVEE = Isla Vista
- MOHK = Mohawk
- NAPL = Naples

2 MPAs= isla vista and naples. MPAs established on Jan 1, 2012. The other 3 sites are not MPAs. 

```{r}
annual_lobsters <- lobster_abundance_sbc %>% 
  #rename(c("AQUA", 'CARP', 'IVEE', 'MOHK', 'NAPL')) #is this supposed to be code or a comment? Do we need to do uncount?
  #change names for the sites here
  group_by(site, year) %>% 
  summarise(yearly_lobsters=sum(count))
  #add column to label site as MPA or not? or can specify that ivee and napl are mpas in the graph code (AMP)
# Maybe we can label the map directly which ones are MPAs vs. Non-MPAs (HGW)

ggplot(annual_lobsters, aes(x=year, y=yearly_lobsters)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=site)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=site))
  
# Update x & y axis labels and title. 

```

#### 2. Result B: Lobster size distribution shifts, 2012 vs 2018


```{r}
lobster_abundance_tidy <- lobster_abundance_sbc %>%
  tidyr::uncount(count) 

lobster_size <- lobster_abundance_tidy # will get back to this. 
```

#### 3. Result C: Compare mean lobster sizes at MPA vs Non-MPA sites (2012 - 2018)
