### Introduction

work in progress 

In 2000, the Santa Barbara Coastal Term Ecological Long-Term Research (SBC LTER) program was established to better understand kelp forest ecosystems in southern California (https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/ ; create citation later). Spiny lobsters (*Panulirus interruptus*, Figure 1), which are a focus of one of many SBC LTER studies, are an important predators in gaint kelp forests (Reed, 2019). Lobster abundance, size, and fishing pressure are part of an annual, on-going study that started in 2012 until, most recently, 2018. Studies were conducted at 5 sites near Santa Barabra County: Carpinteria, Isla Vista, Arroyo Quemado, Mohawk, and Naples (Figure 2). On January 1, 2012, marine protected areas (MPAs) were established at the Isla Vista and Naples sites.

### Data and Methods

Data for spiny lobster abundance, size, and fishing efforts was collected from August 2012 to December 2018 by the [Santa Barbara Coastal Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER)](http://sbc.lternet.edu//index.html). Data was collected annually by divers in late summer before the start of fishing season at five long-term kelp forest study sites. For more information on collection methods and spatial information, please see the [metadata](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=77&revision=newest). Lobster observations were based on observations from a diver searching 2.5 m areas on opposite sides of a 60 m transect tape, searching through cracks, caves, and other structures. Counts and sizes (mm) of lobsters were compared in Marine Protected Areas (MPA) and Non-Marine Protected Areas (Non-MPA). **Complete section about t-tests and alphas after done with A-C**
Trends in lobster counts and sizes were compared in MPA and Non-MPA by linear regression. All analyses and figures were prepared using R software version 3.6.1. Collaboration between authors was done using GitHub. 

### Results
#### 1. Result A: Changes in lobster abundance by site (2012 - 2018)
The effects of creating Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can be seen in Figure 2. At Isla Vista (IVEE), it seems the creation of an MPA has significantly increase the lobster counts from less than 125 individuals in 2012, to over 800 individuals in 2018. Compared to Naples, another MPA, lobster counts stayed relatively constant, similar to Non-MPA sites.  FINISH RESULTS SECTION ...

  ### What do you think with the MPA listed on the graph? 
# weird to say annual, since the lobbsters are counted every month. Only during a couple months.

#### 2. Result B: Lobster size distribution shifts, 2012 vs 2018

Figure __ shows that the lobster size distribution has stayed relatively constant for 4 of the 5 sites: Arroyo Quemado (2012 n=19, 2018 n=27), Carpinteria (2012 n= 39, 2018 n=172), Mohawk (2012 n= 41, 2018 n=82), and Naples (2012 n= 3, 2018 n=149). For these sites, most lobster sizes were around 80mm in both 2012 and 2018. The distributions became narrower and more centrlized around the mean between 2012 and 2018. (does this last sentence make sense? im trying to explain that the 2018 distribution is skinnier). This may be due to the small sample size in 2012, relative to 2018. Likely, a larger sample contained more of the true size distribution at each site.  However, lobster sizes at Isla Vista changed from 2012 to 2018. The lobster sizes were skewed to the left (or right?) in 2012 (n=13), with most surveyed lobster sizes observed around 60mm, but in 2018 (n=472) the distribution of lobster sizes followed a normal distribition that is similar to that of the other 4 sites; most lobster sizes are even around 80mm.

# enter description here
lobster_abundance_tidy <- lobster_abundance_sbc %>%
  tidyr::uncount(count)

# sub-data: keep only years 2012 nad 2018
lobster_size <- lobster_abundance_tidy %>%
  filter(year == c("2018", "2012")) %>% 
  mutate(year=as.character(year)) # this code added becuase ggplot wouldnt recognize our year column correctly (would display color based on year aesthetic). Changing the values to characters helped over come this error

# determine sample size for each class/year
num_observations <- lobster_size %>% 
  group_by(site) %>% 
  count(year)

# plot description
ggplot(lobster_size, aes(x=size_mm)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill=year), position='identity', alpha=0.5) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x="Size (mm)", y="Density\n", title="Change in lobster size distribution between 2012 and 2018") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(lim=c(30, 130), breaks=seq(30,120, by=20)) +
  facet_wrap(~site_name_long, scales="free_x") +
  scale_fill_discrete(name="Year")




## Need help with this. My vision for this graph is to have overlapping histograms for 2012 and 2018, but to facet wrap it by site. I don't think we need to do any statistical analysis until C.  
  # group_by(site)
  # summarize(avg_size = mean(size_mm))
```
